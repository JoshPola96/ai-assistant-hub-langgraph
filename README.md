A modular, multi-agent assistant framework powered by LangGraph, built to handle diverse and complex user queries intelligently.

This is Version 1 (v1) — more agents, refinements, and features will be added soon.

Experience the AI Assistant Hub live on Render:


## 🚀 Overview

AIAssistantHub-LangGraph orchestrates specialized agents to solve user queries in a robust, reflective, and context-aware manner. It leverages:

  * 🤖 **Specialized agents** for real estate, summarization, RAG-based internal QA (Brainwonders), translation, general QA, and utility tasks.
  * 🔁 **Intelligent planning and fallback strategies** using LangGraph's state graph.
  * 🧠 **Prompt engineering** to simulate advanced function chaining and reasoning.

> *Please note: The free tier may experience spin-up delays during initial access after inactivity, and the project relies on free/open-source models and APIs leading to rate limits and modern LLM - LangGraph functionalities like function chaining, worked around using prompt engineering.*

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.11.0**
* **Streamlit:** For the interactive web application frontend.
* **LangChain:** For building powerful LLM applications.
* **LangGraph:** For robust stateful multi-agent orchestration.
* **Google Generative AI (Gemma):** As the underlying Large Language Model.
* **ChromaDB:** For local vector store (e.g., for Brainwonders RAG).
* **Python-Dotenv:** For managing environment variables.
* **Requests & BeautifulSoup4:** For web scraping.
* **PyPDF2:** For PDF document parsing.
* **Duckduckgo Search:** For query bsaed search.
* **Beautifull Soup:** For fetching web content.

## 💻 Setup

To get started with AIAssistantHub-LangGraph, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JoshPola96/AIAssistantHub-LangGraph.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd AIAssistantHub-LangGraph
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

5.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6.  **Configure environment variables:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit your `.env` file to add necessary API keys (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).

## ⚙️ Running the Application

Once setup is complete, run the Streamlit application using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧩 Built-in Agents

AIAssistantHub-LangGraph comes with several specialized agents designed to handle specific types of queries:

  * **🏠 Real Estate Agent:** Handles property queries, listings, trends, and insights. It can also fetch and summarize external property-related data. This agent uses mock data located in `data/real_estate_data/`.

  * **📄 File Summarizer Agent:** Summarizes uploaded documents or entire chat histories. It supports various file types and large text summarization workflows.

  * **🧬 Brainwonders RAG Agent:** Answers internal knowledge base queries specifically about Brainwonders. This agent utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) built from documents stored in `./data/brainwonders_docs`. It requires ChromaDB or similar vector storage for persistence, which is ignored from Git in `data/brainwonders_db/`.

  * **🌐 General QA Agent:** Handles factual or public knowledge questions. It searches the web, fetches relevant pages, and summarizes content as needed. This agent acts as a fallback for general topics not covered by other specialized agents.

  * **🔧 Utility Agent:** Performs a variety of utility tasks including unit conversions, timezone and datetime lookups, geocoding, IP information retrieval, weather forecasts, public holidays, jokes, quotes, and more.

  * **🌍 Translation Agent:** Translates text to user-specified languages. It has the capability to summarize content before or after translation and uses an internal LLM fallback if external translation services are unavailable or fail.

  * **💬 Gemma Fallback Agent:** Provides a last-resort direct response using the Gemma LLM. This agent is activated when all other specialized agents fail to provide a satisfactory response or encounter rate limits (e.g., DuckDuckGo 203 errors).

## 🏗 Future Plans

  * ✨ Add more specialized agents (e.g., travel advisor, calendar, etc).
  * ⚖️ Improve logic flow and structure ensuring robustness.
  * 🔗 Enhance multi-agent function chaining and memory management for more complex interactions.
  * 🌐 Integrate more robust search capabilities and external data sources.
